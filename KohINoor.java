/**
 * The 'Koh-i-Noor' smart contract.
 * 
 * This smart contract was designed to be single, in the sense that there is
 * only one of his category in the entire world.
 * 
 * When created, the contract is <i>owned</i> by the creator and a selling price
 * of 5000 BURST is set. Anyone that transfers more than this amount is the new
 * owner. When a new owner is set, the contract price is automatically increased by
 * 10%.
 * 
 * So, every new owner either have 10% return of investment (minus 1% fee) or
 * keep the ownership of the Koh-i-Noor.
