/**
 * Auction smart contract.
 * 
 * An Auction smart contract that will allow people to send funds which
 * will be refunded back to them (minus the activation fee) if someone
 * else sends more. Minimum bid should be higher than the INITIAL_PRICE.
 * 
 * After the auction timed-out a final transaction (likely to come from
 * the beneficiary) is needed to trigger the payment and close the auction.
 * 
 * This auction contract cannot be reused, once closed or timedout the
 * auction is never open again.
 *
 * Inspired by http://ciyam.org/at/at_auction.html
